Stuff to do:

- [ ] Complete utility functions: - Julia and Ruth
  - [x] Split ratings into testing and training data
    - [ ] Normalize training data 
  - [ ] Write a matrix compeltion function
  - [ ] Write a function that calculates testing and training error (keeping in mind normalization)
- [ ] First aproach: Concatonate the two matricies and do matrix completion with multiple types of user history features
  - [ ] The Entire matrix of user features - Julia
  - [ ] The PCA of the features matrix - Zach and David
  - [ ] The user features clustered and then PCA on each cluster - Ruth and Zuhaeer
- [ ] Second aproach: Treat the user history as 1/2 of the Matrix completion problem (ie. the normalized user history is the P matrix)
  - [ ] The Entire matrix of user features - Julia
  - [ ] The PCA of the features matrix - Zach and David
  - [ ] The user features clustered and then PCA on each cluster - Ruth and Zuhaeer
- [ ] Pick which ever one of the two aproaches is better by testing accuracy - TBA 
- [ ] Use the data from the best aproach on a Matrix completion problem for the entire 4500 row problem with either aproach 1 or 2 - TBA
